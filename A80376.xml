         <editorialDecl>
            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,368 texts created during Phase 1 of the project (2000-2009), initially available only to institutions that contributed to their creation, were released into the public domain on 1 January 2015. The approximately 40,000 texts produced during Phase 2 (2009- ), of which 34,963 had been released as of 2020, originally similarly restricted, were similarly freed from all restrictions on 1 August 2020. As of that date anyone is free to take and use these texts for any purpose (modify them, annotate them, distribute them, etc.). But we do respectfully request that due credit and attribution be given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

            </head>
            <p>THE tyrannicall u≈øurpation of the Bi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>≈øhops, and their Eccle≈øia≈øticall in≈øultati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons hath beene generally acknowledged to be the prime cau≈øe of the≈øe Di≈øcords, and pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mi≈øcuous di≈øtractions among the people at this time. They have been kindling the fire of di≈ø≈øen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion a long time in this kingdome, and now
<pb facs="tcp:126053:3"/> they have almo≈øt brought the ≈øpark of their ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>licious minds to a full flame. But I hope God will ≈øtill divert their wicked intents, and as here<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tofore all their u≈øurping tyrannie, and nefarious machinations <hi>in famum evanuerunt,</hi> have come to nothing, ≈øo ≈øtill their con≈øpiracies ≈øhall be confounded. They have alwayes envied the pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>≈øperitie of good and painfull Mini≈øters of the Go≈øpell, and as they ≈øaw them flouri≈øh the more in the truth of the holy Scripture, gaining the affections of the people, ≈øo ≈øtill the more did they alwayes emulate them. But the Parliament having judiciou≈øly perceived their intents, did not think them fit members of the Hou≈øe, and therefore have placed them in an other hou≈øe more meet for them, I mean the Tower, which they have mo≈øt de≈øerved. Where being com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitted, they ≈øtudied with all diligence, and ≈øe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dulity to ≈øubvert either the intents of tho≈øe, who ≈øhould oppo≈øe them, and were the Authors of their impri≈øonment. Having thus molded their re≈øolution, they privately made ≈øeven Articles again≈øt Mr. <hi>Pym,</hi> and four other worthie Parlia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment men, wherein they were all arraigned of High Trea≈øon. And when they had ob≈øcurely compo≈øed, they ≈øent it to be pre≈øented to the Kings Maje≈øtie, and that he would vouch≈øafe to give his A≈ø≈øent thereunto, and proclaim them Traitors. Thus we may perceive their malicious minds, who, when they ≈øaw men glorious in the kingdome, and that ≈øtood for the ≈øafety, peace
<pb facs="tcp:126053:3"/> and pro≈øperitie of the Realm, did ≈øtudie to ≈øup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plant tho≈øe Noble Members, being the next way to ≈øupplant the whole Kingdome be≈øides. Thus we may under≈øtand their diligence to ≈øet the Ci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tie, and Kingdome together by the ears: thus we may ≈øee their intents to alienate the Vpper Hou≈øe of Parliament from the Lower hou≈øe, and the King from both; yet being ≈øomewhat fru≈øtra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted of their expectation of impri≈øonment of tho≈øe Members, whom they impeached: their malice would not ≈øtop there, but entended farther. And now being cro≈øt in their former ≈øtratagem, they proceeded unto a ≈øecond: wherein they privatly againe, and ob≈øcurely compo≈øed Articles again≈øt M. Calamie, M. Burton, M. Martiall, &amp;c. with di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vers other famous Divines, ≈øtriving to ≈øuppre≈ø≈øe the laborious and painfull Mini≈øters of the <hi>Word and Go≈øpell;</hi> for becau≈øe they could not bring the Parliament into di≈ø≈øen≈øion and di≈øcord a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mong them≈øelves, labouring to eject the chiefe≈øt Members thereof: they ≈øtrived to reduce the Church to Here≈øie, <gap reason="illegible" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>‚Ä¢</desc>
               </gap>nd promi≈øcuous di≈øtracti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons, intending to ≈øu≈øpend the chiefe≈øt pillars thereof,</p>
            <p>But I hope that their envie and emulation will ≈øhortly be di≈ø≈øipated, and although they ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pect the≈øe men with them≈øelves in the tower, yet J beleeve they may ≈øtay long enough for them.</p>
            <p>If the parliament would bee plea≈øed to call the≈øe
<pb facs="tcp:126053:4"/> Bi≈øhops to their triall, it would be great honour to them≈øelves, greater ≈øafety to the Kingdome, and e≈øpecially greate≈øt honour to God and the propagation of his holy Go≈øpell. For they dai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly concurre together in machinations, either how they may depopulate the Realm, or el≈øe how they them≈øelves might ob≈øcurely e≈øcape from the Tower: Once they had concluded to ≈øhave them≈øelves, put on perriwigs, and gray clothes, and ≈øo they thought to have e≈øcaped from thence, but their treacherie was di≈øcovered, and notice given to the Parliament therof. Who did immediately thereupon ≈øend for ≈øome of the Guard, and gave ≈øtricter charge of their fidelity: who very faithfully promi≈øed the ≈øame.</p>
            <p>But the City of <hi>London</hi> being in ≈øuch extreame pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rill, and danger, did induce many to ≈øtand in their own defence; for they knew not what Treachery, the Bi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>≈øhops and other popi≈øh Recu≈øants might con≈øpire a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gain≈øt them.</p>
            <p>Therefore the Trained <gap reason="illegible" extent="2 letters">

But one great abu≈øe done unto the City I cannot omit; when as la≈øt Thur≈øday night ≈øome Company had bin drinking very late in the night, and were re≈øolved to do ≈øome exploit, that ≈øhould be heard of in the City: and one of them immediatly replyed, that they would cry about the ≈øtreets, that the Papi≈øts were ari≈øing, and every man ≈øhould pre≈øently ≈øtand on his owne ≈øafeguard. It was concluded on, and crying thus in the City, and calling for every man to come in his owne defence for feare hee ≈øhould bee burnt in his
<pb facs="tcp:126053:4"/> bed, for the Papi≈øts were ri≈øen. There was immediatly many thou≈øand Citizens came incontinently with their Muskers charged all with bullets, ≈øome with Hal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>berts, others with pikes, ≈øome with ≈øwords and the like weapons, Common-garden was immediatly filled with ≈øouldiers, in Cheap-≈øide there were many thou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>≈øands ≈øtood in their Guard, and in St. Georges Field in Southwarke there was an infinite number of men in Armes. But if the≈øe rogui≈øh di≈øturbers of the city could be apprehended, I doubt not but that they ≈øhould re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive condigne puni≈øhment according to their deme<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rits.</p>
